The goal of `rsat` is to help you handling time-series of satellite images from multiple platforms in a local, efficient, and standardized way. The package provides tools to;

1.  Search
2.  Download
3.  Customize, and
4.  Process

satellite images from Landsat, MODIS, and Sentinel for a region and time of interest.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
# install the package
devtools::install_github("spatialstatisticsupna/rsat")

# you can install the vignette in rsat using the following commands
# install.packages("rmarkdown")
# devtools::install_github("spatialstatisticsupna/rsat", build_vignettes=TRUE)
```

### Linux

In Linux, you need to install additional libraries before starting with `rsat`. Use the following commands for:

-   **Debian/Ubuntu**

<!-- -->

    sudo apt update sudo apt install r-cran-rcpp gdal-bin libgdal-dev libproj-dev openssl openssl-dev xml2 libxml2-dev libmagick++-dev

-   **RedHat/Fedora**

<!-- -->

    sudo dnf install gdal gdal_devel proj_devel xml2 libxml2_devel libcurl_devel openssl_devel ImageMagick-c++\_devel

## Log-in profiles

The registration in the following online portals is required to get a full access to satellite images with `rsat`;

-   [EarthData](https://ers.cr.usgs.gov/register/): A repository of NASA's earth observation data-sets. More information about EarthData can be found [here](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/earth-observation-data).
-   [SciHub](https://scihub.copernicus.eu/dhus/#/self-registration), a web service giving access to Copernicus' scientific data hub. Please go [here](https://scihub.copernicus.eu/) to find more details about the data hub.

For convenience, try to use the same username and password for all of them. To satisfy the criteria of all web services make sure that the username is $4$ characters long and includes a period, number or underscore. The password must be $12$ character long and should include characters with at least one capital letter, and numbers.

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to compute the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index from a MODIS image captured on January 11th, 2020 in northern Spain (Navarre):

``` r
library(rsat)

# replace with your own "username" and "password"
set_credentials("username", "password")

# region and time of interest: rtoi
roi <- ex.navarre
toi <- as.Date("2020-01-11")
rtp <- tempdir()

set_database(file.path(tempdir(), "DATABASE"))

navarre <- new_rtoi("Navarre", roi, rtp)

# search, acquire, customize, and process
rsat_search(region = navarre, product = "mod09ga", dates = toi)
rsat_download(navarre)
rsat_mosaic(navarre, overwrite = TRUE)

rsat_derive(navarre, 
            product = "mod09ga", 
            variable = "NDVI")

# plot the results
plot(navarre, "view" , 
      product = "mod09ga", 
      variable = "NDVI", 
      breaks = seq(0, 1, 0.1))
      
plot(navarre,"dates")
```
